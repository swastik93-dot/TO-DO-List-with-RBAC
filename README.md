# Overview


this  is a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) application designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. It provides users with the ability to create, manage, and segregate their tasks with various search and sort features to easily track their tasks. Additionally, admins can monitor their group members' tasks. I built this application from scratch using Angular.
